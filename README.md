# moms_website

Made with node.js and react.js and a lot of other stuff (it's all in package.json and client/package.json under dependencies)
Thanks to the people who made these tools!

This is supposed to be a website for my mom's jewelry work but it seems like it's just gonna be a sandbox for node.js and react.js
